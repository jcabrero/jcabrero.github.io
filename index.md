# Welcome to my webpage

Welcome to my webpage. My name is José Cabrero Holgueras, I am a PhD student at CERN and Universidad Carlos III in Madrid, where I research Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning. I like to post wherever my research brings me regarding **Homomorphic Encryption**, **Secure Multiparty Computation**, **Differential Privacy** and **Deep Learning** in general. Probably, I will post with other topics that I follow in my spare time.

## Experience

###  CERN Doctoral Student Programme 
#### CERN, Geneva, Switzerland (Nov. 2019 - Now)
Elaboration of my Ph.D. thesis on Privacy Preserving Techniques for Deep Learning. It involves the development and research of *Homomorphic Encryption*, *Secure Multiparty Computation*, *Differential Privacy* and *Federated Learning* in its application to *Deep Learning*.

###  CERN Summer Student Programme
#### CERN, Geneva, Switzerland (Jun. 2018 - Sep. 2018)
Development of a Readout and Management System for Radiation Detection Sensors. Gathering requirements from the project description and other users of the system. Setting up an
embedded web server on an Arduino YUN (IoT device). Performing stress tests to guarantee minimal resilience and reliability of the server. Creation of a minimal web application able to run on such a small platform.

### Research Assistant for C++ 20 Contract Specification Development
#### University Carlos III of Madrid, Madrid, Spain (Sep. 2017 - Jun. 2018)
Implementation of the *P0542R5* specification Implementation of Contract Based Programming for the C++20 release on Clang compiler, following the C++ Standard Specification. Building proofs of concept of the different features. Testing and performance evaluation.}


## Education
