# Welcome to my webpage

Welcome to my webpage. My name is Jos√© Cabrero Holgueras, I am a PhD student at CERN and Universidad Carlos III in Madrid, where I research Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning. I like to post wherever my research brings me regarding **Homomorphic Encryption**, **Secure Multiparty Computation**, **Differential Privacy** and **Deep Learning** in general. Probably, I will post with other topics that I follow in my spare time.

**Opinions are my own and not the views of my present or past employers**
